## **A Modern Single-Page Application for Discovering and Hosting Local Events**

### üåü Project Overview

This project is a dynamic, user-friendly platform designed to connect people with local community events. Built as a single-page application (SPA), the **Community Events Hub** demonstrates a clean, component-based architecture and efficient state management. Users can browse a comprehensive list of events, apply various filters to find what they're looking for, and even host their own events.

### ‚ú® Features

- **Event Filtering & Search:** Easily discover events by searching for keywords or filtering by event type, location, and date.
- **Dynamic Event Creation:** Host a new event through an intuitive form, with the new event immediately appearing on the homepage.
- **Detailed Event View:** Navigate to a dedicated page for each event to view more information, including the host, date, and description.
- **Client-Side Routing:** Experience seamless page transitions without full page reloads, providing a fast and fluid user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring it looks great and works perfectly on any device.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project was developed using a modern and industry-standard tech stack.

- **React:** The core library for building the user interface. I chose React for its component-based model, which makes the UI predictable and easy to manage.
- **React Router:** For declarative client-side routing, enabling fast navigation between different pages.
- **Context API:** Manages the application's global state (the event list) without the need for prop drilling, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.
- **CSS:** For styling and creating a responsive layout using media queries.
